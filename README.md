# AI Article Summarizer

The AI Article Summarizer is a web application that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 through the Article Extractor and Summarizer API to automatically generate concise summaries of articles from various websites. It is built using Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit, RapidAPI and is hosted on Netlify.
